## Blackjack Project ##
### Overview ###
The Blackjack application makes use of a BlackjackPlayer and BlackjackDealer for its main functionality. When a dealer is instantiated a 52-card deck using cards that have Rank and Suit is created and shuffled so that cards may be dealt. Both player and dealer have 'Hands' that the dealer deals cards to. Once the initial turn has been dealt the player's turn begins testing for blackjack to see if player won, or asking for input to hit or stay. Player can continue until they get blackjack, bust, or choose to stay. Dealer's turn then plays out, dealer will always hit when card total is less than 17. Scores are then tallied up and a winner is determined. Player can continue playing more games until choosing to quit.
